# ABCUniversity
-What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The project for ABCU required the analysis of various data structures in order to find which one was the most efficient when it comes to sorting and organizing data. I built and tested each structure to see which was the fastest and most logical given the situation.  

-How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem by analyzing the runtime of the four different data structures that I created. It is important to understand the pros and cons of each data structure when considering which method would best suit this program's needs. For example, understanding the logic of hash tables is important when considering them as the desired data structure. Having a hash table as the data structure for the program would likely result in many collisions, due to the similarity between the course numbers. This makes hash tables a less viable choice, as it would take longer for the courses to be sorted into their bins. 

-How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Any roadblocks I encountered were overcome through perserverence and problem solving. The first thing I do when I run into an issue is try to figure out why it might be happening and where, as well as if it is a logical issue or a syntax issue. If I cannot identify the issue, I will take some time to think about the task I am asking the program to perform to try and come up with a solution. If that does not work, I will turn to Google to find an answer. 

-How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Before my work on this project, I was unfamiliar with how data structures were implemented in C++. Now that I have a different perspective on how they are applied, I have a deeper understanding of the overall logical processes associated with programming. I previously thought hash tables and binary trees were their own structures, but now I undertand they are designed to work with vectors instead.

-How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
 
Whenever I think of designing a program, I try to consider the steps I would take to complete the task in it's simplest form. With the knowledge I obtained from this class, I now know I must go one step further and attempt to automate the process, or at the very least find the most efficient way to design the code. This will keep code shorter, which will increase readability. Having efficient and well designed code will also make it adaptable and maintainable, since there will be less code overall to change and maintain.
